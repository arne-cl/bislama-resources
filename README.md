# bislama-resources

Resources for the language Bislama (Bichelamar), an English-based creole,
which is one of the official languages of Vanuatu.

## Language learning

* [Pidginise your English](http://www.pentecostisland.net/languages/bislama/guide.htm), a short, written introduction
to the language for speakers of English

## Media

* [Liahona magazine in Bislama](https://www.lds.org/liahona/2014?lang=bis).  
  Liahona is a monthly religious magazine published by the Latter Day Saints. Many issues (but not all of them)
  are translated into lots of underresourced languages.
* [Vanuatu Daily Post](http://www.dailypost.vu/), mostly in English but has some short articles in Bislama
* [Vanuatu Daily Digest](https://vanuatudaily.wordpress.com/), a blog summarizing news from Vanuatu;  
  lots of links to local media outlets, blogs etc. (mostly English, though)
